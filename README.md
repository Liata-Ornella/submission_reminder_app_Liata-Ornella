# Submission Reminder App

The **Submission Reminder App** is a simple tool designed to track student assignment submissions. It reminds instructors of students who haven't submitted their assignments, helping them to manage deadlines effectively.

The application consists of two main shell scripts:

1. **`create_environment.sh`**: This script sets up the app environment and generates the necessary directory structure and files.
2. **`update_assignment.sh`**: This script allows you to update the assignment name and re-run the app to check for new submissions.

## Prerequisites

- Bash shell (any version that supports basic shell commands)
- A UNIX-like environment (Linux, macOS, or WSL on Windows)
- Ensure that the user running the script has the necessary permissions to execute shell scripts.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
