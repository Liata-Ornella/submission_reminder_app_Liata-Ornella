# - '2s' means apply the substitution command to the second line of the file.
# - '^ASSIGNMENT=.*' is a regular expression that matches the line starting with 'ASSIGNMENT=' and any characters following it.
# - 'ASSIGNMENT=\"${ASSIGNMENT_NAME}\"' is the replacement text, where the value of 'ASSIGNMENT_NAME' is inserted.
#   Using double quotes around the replacement value ensures that multi-word assignment names are handled correctly.
